#### The relationship between body mass and metabolic rate ####

This repository contains the R code used for the answer in [Statistical method
for characterizing the relationship between body mass and metabolic rate](https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/66659/36209). The purpose of this exercise was to investigate whether fitting either a linear model to log-transformed data or a non-linear model directly to the un-transformed data is more appropriate, as well as for me to start learning the R language.

The data used were acquired from [Kolokotrones et al. 2010][1] who originally took them from McNab ([2008][2]).

The final figure was put together in Inkscape.
